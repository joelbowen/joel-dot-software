context: After many years of cultivating an unspoken culture, a global consulting firm joined forces with another consultancy and needed to codify its culture and ways of working. Stakeholder and end-user interviews showed no clear understanding of cultural “norms” or central knowledge-bases for team members to discover ways of working.

#### Challenges

One of the first challenges was establishing a shared language for what people wanted. Many individuals and groups had tried to solve this problem with one-off solutions or group-specific knowledge repositories. Additionally, the business had only a few “north-star” expressions of their culture, such as a set of Core Value statements that needed to be updated.

#### Solution

After speaking with business leaders, managers, and delivery team members, I established a framework of understanding for defining culture as a pyramid with layers representing Values, Beliefs, Behaviors, Teachings, and Actions. Applying this framework, I lead a series of working groups over many months to codify Values, Beliefs, and Behaviors in a public document. We then built a self-service knowledge base for sharing Teachings and Actions. Finally, we launched an open community of employees to curate these spaces while actively engaging peers in content creation and feedback.
