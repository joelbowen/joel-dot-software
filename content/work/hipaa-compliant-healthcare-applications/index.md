context: In 2015, many healthcare startups found it remarkably difficult to navigate the HIPAA Privacy and Security rules. I worked with several companies to educate them on the details of HIPAA, their entity type, the implications of regulation on their business and architectural strategies, and to guide them through the development of compliant platforms and applications.

### Challenges

Healthcare regulations for covered entities and their business associates are not simple, straightforward, or concise. Responsible businesses that want to disrupt the healthcare space must first understand their responsibilities under the law and then often spend a significant amount of time and energy developing appropriate policies and technical architectures to educate their employees and satisfy these regulations.

### Solution

I put together a playbook through extensive research and education that my clients could use to establish their policies, training programs, and legal agreements to work with covered entities as business associates. I helped them design, build, and bring innovative applications to market running on HIPAA compliant infrastructure at a reasonable cost. Regulation shouldn't suppress innovation, and my clients enjoyed the freedom of modern application development practices and the confidence of established policies, educated workforces, and compliant application architectures and infrastructure.
