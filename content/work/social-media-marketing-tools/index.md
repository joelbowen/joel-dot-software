### Challenges

The application needed to integrate with an existing identity provider and operate on managed self-healing cloud infrastructure. The business wanted three front-end applications, one for business and one for client workflows with a secure media plan ordering system that didn't require clients to sign up for user accounts.

### Solution

We built a GraphQL API running on Node using Apollo server and an ORM. In 2017, GraphQL already mature enough to make the application feel particularly snappy with features like optimistic queries and subscriptions. Initially, my role was to architect a simple solution with self-healing infrastructure and a codebase that would only need occasional maintenance. As we moved into our build and iteration, I led the cross-functional team and contributed most of the front-end application code. I also participated heavily in user research, UX design, and other product discovery activities, acting as a product owner.
