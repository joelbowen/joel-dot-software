context: An international retail giant needed to modernize how its community relations teams built digital products and reported annual growth. They wanted a fresh community-centric web presence, legacy systems integrations, and engaging digital applications for underserved communities to engage young girls and boys in STEM education.

### Challenges

The existing teams spent weeks and months each year turning physical records into digital records, primarily spreadsheets, to articulate their impact in the community and defend their annual budget. The teams dreamed of building engaging digital experiences outside these efforts to demystify technology and interest young children in STEM careers.

### Solution

I worked with existing teams to digitize their record-keeping process and automate key aspects of their outreach efforts. We rebuilt their web presence to be vibrant and engaging, and we developed immersive applications that transformed student learning and real-time reporting. I worked closely with enterprise teams to integrate new data streams into legacy systems, record engagement with retail record-keeping tools, and allow groups of junior engineers and retail employees to impact their communities through software engineering.
