### Challenges

The Studio needed to be a functional physical space where employees spent time away from their regular job for days, weeks, or months. Beyond space design, they needed an operating model that reflected their commitment to agile principles and customer engagement. All of this while operating within the bounds of strict legal risk and compliance of a regulated industry.

### Solution

I acted as the Studio Director and wrote an operating model that outline equipment and furniture, roles and responsibilities, agile ceremonies, ideation workshop, user testing, tools and techniques, corporate engagement, and more. I helped establish the teams in their new space and served as the Studio Director during the first year. We spent countless hours with users and validated ideas that changed business operations and improved products while empowering employees to drive innovation behaviors at all levels.
