context: One of the most prominent digital media companies in the United States needed to improve how they surfaced opportunities and insights to their teams. They also wanted to make business-critical data accessible to various business units, including their Data Science group for large-scale research projects.

### Challenges

To enable these teams with critical data, we first had to identify their core use cases and establish a proper information hierarchy. Furthermore, data access from primary providers incurred costly per-access fees, and bulk data users (such as the data science team) needed to access millions of records per request.

### Solution

We worked closely with end-users to design a powerful application that allowed them to access critical data in an accessible format, enabling their teams to drive business outcomes. We also built an API powered by serverless functions that could query billions of records per request without incurring any per-access fees from data providers. Additionally, we made powerful SEO analysis tools capable of analyzing search engine behavior and subsequent website performance.
