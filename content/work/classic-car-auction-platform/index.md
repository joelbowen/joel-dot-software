### Challenges

There were many challenges to building this platform. Auction managers needed powerful tools to create premium listings and moderate user engagement. Bid reconciliation and visual feedback had to be fast and accurate to ensure fair auctions. Additionally, auction closings had to satisfy all interested parties, and money exchanges needed to happen securely.

### Solution

I worked with the business for many weeks to identify architecturally significant requirements, desired quality attributes, and business principles that would guide the architecture. We interviewed target users, established personas and considered many commercially available off-the-shelf platforms. Ultimately, we architected and built an innovative solution that existing IT teams could support, and we validated the outputs through rigorous user testing and iteration.
