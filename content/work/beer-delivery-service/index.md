context: An advertising agency wanted to develop a mobile application for a startup working on a subscription service to regularly ship craft brews to subscribers. The mobile application needed to capture feedback on deliveries, establish a taste profile, show detailed information on thousands of different brews, and allow the user to manage their profile and delivery preferences.

### Challenges

The chosen mobile application technology (hybrid mobile) presented several technical feasibility challenges, especially in device APIs and performance. Additionally, the client's first-choice backend-as-a-service (Parse) was being sunset by Facebook and had to migrate to a new long-term solution.

### Solution

We built a performant mobile application using Ionic and made details of each brew available through the Untappd API. I was responsible for bringing the high-fidelity designs of an exacting design team to life and tasked with engaging the client toward a long-term API strategy. We worked towards migrating the BaaS away from Parse and towards a self-hosted NoSQL solution and built automated build and deployment tooling.
