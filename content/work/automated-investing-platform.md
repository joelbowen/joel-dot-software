### Challenges

The application needed to support several different interaction modes depending on portfolio type, risk profile, and localization, among other things. Over time, the codebase would mature through early Angular versions and eventually transition to React. Additionally, multiple development teams were dedicated to individual "flavors" of the application and shared a single codebase.

### Solution

The application was written in TypeScript, with feature flags and build configurations to manage each development team's different flavors. I was a contributing software engineer focused initially on feature development. Eventually, I focused on technology transitions, moving the front-end architecture towards a component design pattern, and changing the build system from Grunt to Webpack.
